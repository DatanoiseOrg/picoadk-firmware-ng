# PicoADK NG Firmware

This is a work-in-progress rework of the Datanoise PicoADK V2 firmware with a focus on modularity.

# Note

This is work-in-progress and most likely things are still not implemented or broken.

## Prerequisites

### MacOS
To build this project, you need to install the following tools:
On macOS (using Homebrew)

Install Homebrew (if not installed):

```console
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Install the required tools:

```console
brew install cmake gcc-arm-embedded git cpplint
```

### Debian/Ubuntu

Update and install the required packages:

```console
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi build-essential git cpplint
```


# Windows
Follow the instructions for Debian/Ubuntu inside your WSL instance.

## Building

Clone the PicoADK NG Firmware repository:

```console
git clone --recursive --recurse-submodules https://github.com/DatanoiseOrg/picoadk-firmware-ng.git
cd picoadk-firmware-ng
```

Create a build directory:

```console
mkdir build
cd build
```

Run CMake to generate the build system:

```console
cmake ..
```

Build the project:

```console
make ( Add -j to build in parallel using all your CPU cores )
```

This will create the firmware binaries in the **build** directory.

## Flashing

You can use any standard method to flash the generated .uf2 file onto your PicoADK V2 board, such as dragging and dropping the file onto the mounted drive after entering bootloader mode.
